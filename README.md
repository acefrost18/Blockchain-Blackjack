Intro to Blockchain group project that seeks to implement Blackjack in Solidity

## <ins>Purpose</ins>
Blackjack in a casino setting is riddled with doubt, misdirection, and distrust. Players who are adept at the game, despite the house's best efforts, are coerced to leave an establishment immediately and often blacklisted. 
This project aims to bring an illuminating light into this high risk/reward game darkened by casinos throwing around their weight.
Through the transparency of blockchain, the shuffling and dealing of cards will be clearly visible and verifiable to all players, unlike casinos who employ dealers with enough sleight of hand proficiency to be considered magicians.
Along with blockchain's immutability, bet settlement disputes would cease to exist, ***all bets are final***.

We want to create a version of Blackjack that ensures the players' trust is well placed and rewards those capable of excelling at the game.
